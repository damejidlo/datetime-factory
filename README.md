# Motivation
In our application you should never obtain NOW via `new DateTime()` or from SQL `NOW()`. Because it's unmockable
and therefore untestable.

This ultra-simple library provides service you can easily use and mock.

# Install
```
composer require damejidlo/datetime-factory
```

And then just register it in your `config.neon` as a service.

# Example (of mocking in tests)
```php
trait MockDateTimeFactoryTrait
{
	/** @return Container */
	abstract function getContainer();

	private function mockDateTimeFactoryService(\DateTime $subjectTime)
	{
		$dateTimeFactory = Mockery::mock(DateTimeFactory::class);
		$dateTimeFactory->shouldReceive('getNow')->andReturn($subjectTime);
		$this->getContainer()->removeService('dateTimeFactory');
		$this->getContainer()->addService('dateTimeFactory', $dateTimeFactory);
	}
}
```
